This is a blank gradle project with a pre-created source code structure that can be changed.
I created this because when eclipse creates a new gradle project, it is completely empty
and has no directory structure for code and resources.  I would very much prefer to have
that structure and the associated build path already set up when I start on a new project.

It started as a spring boot project, those elements are commented in build.gradle so they
can be uncommented.
